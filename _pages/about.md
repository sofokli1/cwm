Hello everyone, I am Mina!

Spending most of my time in the kitchen I love cooking and preparing meals for my family! Here I share some recipes I follow very often and some new things that I try to experiment. The main goal of my recipes is to be delicious, simple, easy and sometimes quick! Remember to enjoy cooking and everyone will taste it! You can also see my recipes on my [Cook with Mina YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9d2ER0kvzSM7lTEmfp9iuw)! Thank you for visiting my site and hope to see you again very soon! 

Cheers!
